        "detailed_markdown": "# Asset allocation by age (100 âˆ’ age rule)\n\n*Short rule:* Use 100 âˆ’ age as a starting guideline for % in equity. For conservative planning use 90 âˆ’ age or 110 âˆ’ age for more growth.\n\n*Why it matters:* Younger investors have longer time horizons and can tolerate volatility; allocation should match goals and risk tolerance.\n\n*Steps to apply:*\n1. Calculate base equity = 100 âˆ’ age.\n2. Adjust by Â±10â€“15% based on risk tolerance.\n3. Decide debt vs gold split for remaining allocation.\n4. Rebalance annually or when allocation drifts >5%.\n\n*Examples:*\n- Age 25 â†’ Equity â‰ˆ 75% (100âˆ’25), Debt+Gold â‰ˆ 25%.\n- Age 45 â†’ Equity â‰ˆ 55%, Debt+Gold â‰ˆ 45%.\n\n*Caveats:* This is a guideline, not personalized advice. For near-term goals (<3 years) reduce equity exposure.",

The expense ratio is lower because no distributor commission is paid.\n- *Regular Plans:* You buy through an intermediary (distributor, broker, or agent). The expense ratio is higher to cover the commission paid to the intermediary.\n- *Impact:* Over the long term, the lower expense ratio of direct plans can result in significantly higher returns due to the power of compounding. For example, a 1% difference in expense ratio over 25 years on a â‚¹10,000 monthly SIP can lead to a corpus that is over â‚¹25 lakhs larger.\n- *When to choose which:* Always prefer Direct plans if you can manage your own research. Use Regular plans only if you are receiving valuable, unbiased advice and portfolio management service from the distributor.",

        "detailed_markdown": "## Comparing the New and Old Tax Regimes\n\nIndia offers two tax regimes for individuals to choose from each financial year. The best choice depends on your income and the deductions you are eligible to claim.\n\n### ðŸ§¾ New Tax Regime (Default)\nThis is the default regime since FY 2023-24. It is designed for simplicity.\n\n- **Lower Tax Slabs**: The tax rates are generally lower across different income brackets compared to the old regime.\n- **No Major Deductions**: Most common deductions and exemptions are not allowed. This includes Section 80C (PPF, ELSS, EPF), Section 80D (Health Insurance), HRA, and home loan interest on self-occupied property.\n- **Standard Deduction**: A standard deduction of â‚¹50,000 is available for salaried individuals.\n- **Best For**: Individuals with few investments or deductions to claim. It simplifies tax filing significantly.\n\n### ðŸ§¾ Old Tax Regime (Opt-in)\nYou can choose to opt into this regime if it is more beneficial for you.\n\n- **Higher Tax Slabs**: The tax rates are higher compared to the new regime.\n- **Allows Deductions**: You can claim over 70 deductions and exemptions to reduce your taxable income. Key ones include:\n  - **Section 80C**: Up to â‚¹1.5 Lakh (PPF, ELSS, EPF, Life Insurance, etc.)\n  - **Section 80D**: Health insurance premiums.\n  - **HRA**: House Rent Allowance.\n  - **Home Loan**: Interest on home loan.\n  - **NPS**: Contribution to National Pension System.\n- **Best For**: Individuals who make significant use of tax-saving investment and expenditure options. If your total deductions are high (typically over â‚¹2.5 - â‚¹3.75 Lakhs), this regime is often more tax-efficient.",
