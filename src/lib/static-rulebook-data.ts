Calculate base equity = 100 âˆ’ age.\n2. Adjust by Â±10â€“15% based on risk tolerance.\n3. Decide debt vs gold split for remaining allocation.\n4. Rebalance annually or when allocation drifts >5%.\n\n*Examples:*\n- Age 25 â†’ Equity â‰ˆ 75% (100âˆ’25), Debt+Gold â‰ˆ 25%.\n- Age 45 â†’ Equity â‰ˆ 55%, Debt+Gold â‰ˆ 45%.\n\n*Caveats:* This is a guideline, not personalized advice.

This includes Section 80C (PPF, ELSS, EPF), Section 80D (Health Insurance), HRA, and home loan interest on self-occupied property.\n- **Standard Deduction**: A standard deduction of â‚¹50,000 is available for salaried individuals.\n- **Best For**: Individuals with few investments or deductions to claim. It simplifies tax filing significantly.\n\n### ðŸ§¾ Old Tax Regime (Opt-in)\nYou can choose to opt into this regime if it is more beneficial for you.\n\n- **Higher Tax Slabs**: The tax rates are higher compared to the new regime.\n- **Allows Deductions**: You can claim over 70 deductions and exemptions to reduce your taxable income. Key ones include:\n  - **Section 80C**: Up to â‚¹1.5 Lakh (PPF, ELSS, EPF, Life Insurance, etc.)\n  - **Section 80D**: Health insurance premiums.\n  - **HRA**: House Rent Allowance.\n  - **Home Loan**: Interest on home loan.\n  - **NPS**: Contribution to National Pension System.\n- **Best For**: Individuals who make significant use of tax-saving investment and expenditure options.
