        "detailed_markdown": "# Asset allocation by age (100 − age rule)\n\n*Short rule:* Use 100 − age as a starting guideline for % in equity. For conservative planning use 90 − age or 110 − age for more growth.\n\n*Why it matters:* Younger investors have longer time horizons and can tolerate volatility; allocation should match goals and risk tolerance.\n\n*Steps to apply:*\n1. Calculate base equity = 100 − age.\n2. Adjust by ±10–15% based on risk tolerance.\n3. Decide debt vs gold split for remaining allocation.\n4. Rebalance annually or when allocation drifts >5%.\n\n*Examples:*\n- Age 25 → Equity ≈ 75% (100−25), Debt+Gold ≈ 25%.\n- Age 45 → Equity ≈ 55%, Debt+Gold ≈ 45%.\n\n*Caveats:* This is a guideline, not personalized advice. For near-term goals (<3 years) reduce equity exposure.",

The expense ratio is lower because no distributor commission is paid.\n- *Regular Plans:* You buy through an intermediary (distributor, broker, or agent). The expense ratio is higher to cover the commission paid to the intermediary.\n- *Impact:* Over the long term, the lower expense ratio of direct plans can result in significantly higher returns due to the power of compounding. For example, a 1% difference in expense ratio over 25 years on a ₹10,000 monthly SIP can lead to a corpus that is over ₹25 lakhs larger.\n- *When to choose which:* Always prefer Direct plans if you can manage your own research. Use Regular plans only if you are receiving valuable, unbiased advice and portfolio management service from the distributor.",
